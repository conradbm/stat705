We continue to examine the three F tests for two-way ANOVA (one test for the main effect of factor A, one test for the main effect of factor B, and one test for their interaction).  In this lesson, we develop the test statistics to determine if the effects are statistically significant.  These are all based on least squares estimates, which are formed by partitioning the total sum of squares.  The results can be summarized in an ANOVA table.  This is analogous to what we did with one-way designs.
