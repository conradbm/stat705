Pairwise comparisons from the previous lesson are limited to comparing two treatment means at a time.  For some research objectives, more general comparisons are needed.  As an example, suppose we are comparing 4 recipes (treatments) on the quality of baked bread.  (The quality of each loaf of bread will be assigned by taste testers.)  Our 4 recipes are the following: (1) high fat, high fiber; (2) high fat, low fiber; (3) low fat, high fiber; and (4) low fat, low fiber.  This is actually two-factor experiment (with factors Fat and Fiber), which we will discuss in more detail in the next module.   For now, we consider these treatments as a one-way design so the corresponding means are \mu_1,\:\mu_2,\:\mu_3,\:\mu_4µ 1 , µ 2 , µ 3 , µ 4.  

The mean quality for the high fat recipes is   and for low fat it is  .  To compare high fat to low fat, we need to test

     H_0\colon 0.5\mu_1+0.5\mu_2=\:0.5\mu_3+0.5\:\mu_4\:H 0 : 0.5 µ 1 + 0.5 µ 2 = 0.5 µ 3 + 0.5 µ 4

vs. H_0\colon 0.5\mu_1+0.5\mu_2\ne\:0.5\mu_3+0.5\:\mu_4\:H 0 : 0.5 µ 1 + 0.5 µ 2 ? 0.5 µ 3 + 0.5 µ 4

This is not a straight comparison of two means, so the techniques in the previous section cannot be applied.

Methods for performing this hypothesis test are explained in the section.   (There are no "Check Your Knowledge" questions this time.)
