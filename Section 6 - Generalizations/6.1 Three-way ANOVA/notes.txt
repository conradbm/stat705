As we near the end of the course, we now examine more general linear models.  We begin with a natural extension of two-way factorial experiments in which three factors are manipulated by the researcher in order to determine the effect on some response variable.  We analyze three-way factorial data with Analysis of Variance, in a manner similar to that of two-way ANOVA.  The analysis is slightly more complicated, since we now have three-way interactions to consider.
